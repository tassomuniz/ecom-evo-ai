# Evo AI - AI Agents Platform (Frontend)

Evo AI is an open-source platform for creating and managing AI agents, enabling integration with different AI models and services.

## üöÄ Overview

The Evo AI frontend platform enables:

- User-friendly interface for creating and managing AI agents
- Integration with different language models
- Client management
- Visual configuration of MCP servers
- Custom tools management
- JWT authentication with email verification
- **Agent 2 Agent (A2A) Protocol Support**: Interface for interoperability between AI agents following Google's A2A specification
- **Workflow Agent with ReactFlow**: Visual interface for building complex agent workflows
- **Secure API Key Management**: Interface for encrypted storage of API keys
- **Agent Organization**: Folder structure for organizing agents by categories

## üß© Agent Creation Interface

The frontend offers intuitive interfaces for creating different types of agents:

### 1. LLM Agent (Language Model)

Interface for configuring agents based on models like GPT-4, Claude, etc. with tools, MCP servers, and sub-agents.

### 2. A2A Agent (Agent-to-Agent)

Interface for implementing Google's A2A protocol for agent interoperability.

### 3. Sequential Agent

Interface for executing sub-agents in a specific order.

### 4. Parallel Agent

Interface for executing multiple sub-agents simultaneously.

### 5. Loop Agent

Interface for executing sub-agents in a loop with a defined number of iterations.

### 6. Workflow Agent

Visual interface based on ReactFlow for creating complex workflows between agents.
